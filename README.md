Food Delivery Time Prediction 


Project Overview

This project aims to predict food delivery times based on historical delivery data using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The project addresses the challenge of accurately estimating delivery times, which is crucial for customer satisfaction in the food delivery industry. The LSTM model is designed to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the delivery data to provide more accurate predictions.
Features

    Time Series Prediction: Leverage LSTM networks to predict delivery times based on past data.
    Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw delivery data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
    Model Evaluation: Use metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate model performance.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the LSTM model by tuning key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers.

Technologies Used

    Python: Main programming language.
    TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    NumPy: Numerical computing.
    Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
    plotty: Data visualization.

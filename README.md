Food Delivery Time Prediction 


Project Overview

This project aims to predict food delivery times based on historical delivery data using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The project addresses the challenge of accurately estimating delivery times, which is crucial for customer satisfaction in the food delivery industry. The LSTM model is designed to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the delivery data to provide more accurate predictions.
Features

    Time Series Prediction: Leverage LSTM networks to predict delivery times based on past data.
    Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw delivery data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
    Model Evaluation: Use metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate model performance.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the LSTM model by tuning key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers.

Technologies Used

    Python: Main programming language.
    TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    NumPy: Numerical computing.
    Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
    Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.

Installation

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-time-prediction.git
cd food-delivery-time-prediction

Install Required Packages:
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements:
The requirements.txt file should include:

text

    tensorflow
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    jupyter

Usage

    Load the Dataset:
    Place your dataset in the data/ directory in .csv format.

    Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open food_delivery_time_prediction.ipynb.

    bash

    jupyter notebook

    Training the Model:
    Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train the LSTM model.

    Prediction:
    Use the trained model to predict delivery times on new or unseen data. The notebook includes examples of how to generate predictions and evaluate model performance.

Dataset

The dataset should include historical data on food deliveries with at least the following columns:

    Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
    Order Time: Timestamp when the order was placed.
    Preparation Time: Time taken by the restaurant to prepare the food.
    Distance: Distance between the restaurant and the delivery location.
    Weather Conditions: Weather data at the time of delivery (optional but useful for prediction).
    Traffic Conditions: Traffic conditions at the time of delivery (optional but useful for prediction).
    Actual Delivery Time: Actual time taken for the delivery.

Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and formatted correctly before feeding it into the model.
Model Architecture

    LSTM Layers: The model is built using LSTM layers to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.
    Dense Layers: After the LSTM layers, Dense layers are used for the final prediction.
    Dropout: Dropout layers are included to prevent overfitting.
    Activation Function: The ReLU activation function is used in the Dense layers, with the final layer using a linear activation function.

Results

The results section in the notebook will display:

    The performance of the model on the test set, including metrics like MAE and RMSE.
    Visualizations comparing predicted vs. actual delivery times.
    A discussion on the model's accuracy and potential areas for improvement.
